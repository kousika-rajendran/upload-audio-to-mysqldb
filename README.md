# upload-audio-to-mysqldb
This program helps the user to upload an audio file to the MYSQL database. Users can also view all the uploaded audio files and play them.
I used the XAMPP Server to run PHP files.
You are required to create an empty folder named uploads. Once created, right-click on the folder, and in the drop-down menu select properties. 
Click security under the groups or username click administrative and allow full permission.
